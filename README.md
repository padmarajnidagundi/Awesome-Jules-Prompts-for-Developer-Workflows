//Summarise the latest commit history into a changelog entry for the next release.

// Generate developer onboarding instructions for this repo.

# ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD & Automation
// Create a GitHub Actions workflow to run unit tests on each push.

// Add a CI step for linting with {linter} (e.g., ESLint, Flake8).

// Set up build automation for this {Node/Python/Go} project.

// Add deployment pipeline config for {platform} (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GCP Cloud Run).

// Write a job in GitHub Actions to automatically label PRs with affected areas (e.g., "backend", "frontend").

# üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Code Modernization & Migration
// Migrate this code from Python 2 to Python 3 syntax and libraries.

// Convert this React class component to a functional component using hooks.

// Rewrite this Express.js route in Fastify.

// Modernize JavaScript codebase by replacing var with let/const and using arrow functions where applicable.

# ü§ñ AI-Native + Jules-Specific
// Generate an audio changelog summarizing changes from the past {X} commits.

// Summarize the latest PRs and pending reviews as a Slack-ready status update.

// Propose the next engineering task based on the open issues and recent commits.

// Draft a pull request description for the following branch: {branch_name}.

// Suggest backlog grooming actions based on stale issues and PRs.

// Create a project progress summary for non-technical stakeholders.

# üîê Security & Compliance
// Scan this project for common security vulnerabilities.

// Add input validation and sanitization for user inputs in {file}.

// Suggest how to prevent SQL injection in {function}.

// Check for usage of outdated cryptographic algorithms in {file}.

// Add missing authorization checks for protected routes in {API module}.

# üìà Analytics & Metrics Instrumentation
// Add OpenTelemetry traces to {function/module}.

// Instrument performance metrics for {API endpoint}.

# üìÇ Project Bootstrap & Boilerplate
// Generate a minimal Python CLI tool using Typer.

// Scaffold a React + Vite + TypeScript project with Tailwind CSS.

// Set up a Flask REST API with basic CRUD endpoints.

// Create a .gitignore suitable for a {language/framework} project.

# Prompting Best Practices (for Jules)
‚úÖ Be explicit: State file names, functions, or error messages.

‚úÖ Be action-oriented: Start with verbs like ‚ÄúRefactor‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdd tests‚Äù, ‚ÄúFix‚Äù, ‚ÄúDocument‚Äù.

‚úÖ Be scoped: Focus on one file/module or clear task per prompt.

‚úÖ Review the Jules plan output before accepting and triggering PRs.
